This repo hosts my Contextual Data Logic (CDL) frameworks or RAG files. CDL frameworks work by uploading a file to an LLM (or creating a gem) and it acts as prompt/context engineering (and possibly a dataset) for an LLM to work with (the RAG.) CDL is a meta-programming technique, effectively bootstrapping projects for LLMs.

To use:

Download the .'x'.md file and upload it to your favorite LLM, or use it to create a gemini gem or custom GPT.
